## How It Works

### Backend (Flask)
- Serves the React frontend
- Provides `/api/search` endpoint for keyword searches
- Searches across conversation names, summaries, and messages
- Supports deep search mode for content blocks

### Frontend (React)
- In-browser React with Babel Standalone (no build step needed)
- Uses Lucide icons for UI elements
- Responsive design with modern styling
- Real-time search with debouncing

## Search Tips

1. **Basic search**: Type keywords and press Enter to search titles, summaries, and messages
2. **Deep search**: Enable "Deep search" checkbox to also search within content blocks (slower but more thorough)
3. **Multiple results**: Each card shows where the keyword was found (badges: Title, Summary, Message, Content)
4. **View conversation**: Click any result card to open the full conversation in a modal
5. **Search within conversation**: Use the search box in the modal to find specific terms within that conversation
6. **Navigate matches**: Use the up/down arrow buttons or press Enter (next) / Shift+Enter (previous) to jump between matches

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/search`
Search conversations by keyword.

**Query Parameters:**
- `q` (string, required) - Search keyword
- `deep` (boolean, optional) - Enable deep search (default: false)

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "uuid": "...",
    "name": "Conversation title",
    "summary": "Summary text...",
    "created_at": "2025-10-22T23:20:18.677259Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-22T23:21:40.240135Z",
    "message_count": 10,
    "match_locations": ["title", "summary"]
  }
]
```
