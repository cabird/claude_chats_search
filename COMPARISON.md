# Flask vs Static Version Comparison

## Two Versions Available

### 1. Flask Version (`index.html` + `app.py`)

**Use when:**
- Running locally on your own machine
- You want faster searches (server-side)
- You have Python installed

**How to run:**
```bash
python app.py -p 5000
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Faster search (server does the work)
- ✅ Pre-loaded data (conversations.json loaded once at startup)
- ✅ Smaller initial page load

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires Python + Flask
- ❌ Need to run a server
- ❌ Can't host on GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel

---

### 2. Static Version (`index_static.html`)

**Use when:**
- Want to host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
- No backend/server available
- Want maximum portability
- Want to share with others easily

**How to run:**
```bash
# Option 1: Open directly
open index_static.html

# Option 2: Simple server
python -m http.server 8000

# Option 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages
# Just upload and enable Pages!
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ No backend needed - 100% client-side
- ✅ Can host anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop file upload
- ✅ Your data never leaves your browser
- ✅ Works offline (after initial load)
- ✅ Easy to share - just send a link

**Cons:**
- ❌ Must upload conversations.json each time
- ❌ Slightly slower search (browser does the work)
- ❌ Initial file load time (~1-2 seconds for 13MB)

- ✅ You want to host it online (GitHub Pages, etc.)

- ✅ You care about privacy (data stays in browser)
- ✅ You want drag-and-drop file upload
- ✅ You want maximum portability

## Deployment Examples

### Flask Version
```bash
# Local
python app.py -p 5000

# Production (e.g., Heroku, Railway, Render)
# Requires Python server hosting
```

### Static Version
```bash
# GitHub Pages
git add .
git commit -m "Add conversations search"
git push
# Enable Pages in repo settings

# Netlify
# Just drag-and-drop the folder at netlify.com/drop

# Vercel
vercel deploy

# Any static host
# Just upload index_static.html + components/
```

---

## Recommendation

**For most users:** Use the **Static Version** (`index_static.html`)
- No setup required
- Easy to share
- Deployable anywhere
- Privacy-focused

**For advanced users:** Use the **Flask Version** if you need server-side processing or have specific hosting requirements.
